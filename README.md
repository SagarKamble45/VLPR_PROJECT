VLPR_PROJECT

Web-based VLPR is a system that uses cameras and image processing
 technology to automatically capture, analyze, and recognize vehicle license
 plates. Unlike traditional VLPR systems, web-based VLPR operates over
 the internet, allowing users to access and manage the collected data
 through a web interface. It is often used for various applications, such as
 parking management, security, and traffic monitoring, often the
 convenience of remote access and real-time insights. We aim to deliver a
 system that is easy to use and can be scaled to meet the needs of any
 organization.
